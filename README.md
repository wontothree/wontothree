Hi, This is Anthony Garcia (or Sewon Kim).

I enjoy bringing mathematically sophisticated theories into reality, but I always strive to maintain a sense of balance between theory and implementation.

Outside of my career, I’m from Seoul, South Korea. I’m passionate about jazz and heavy metal music, and I enjoy playing acoustic and electric guitar.
